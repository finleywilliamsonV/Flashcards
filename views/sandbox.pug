      h2 I LOVE BOB ROSS
      p#bob-ross-text This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Take your time. Speed will come later. We have a fantastic little sky! If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.
